## üèÖ Pro Tips for Optimal Positioning

### General Guidelines:
- **Start with presets** - Use game-specific presets as a baseline
- **Test in practice mode** - Always test position changes before competitive play
- **Consider your playstyle** - Aggressive players might prefer different positioning than passive players
- **Monitor size matters** - Larger monitors may require different positioning

### Game-Specific Tips:

#### First-Person Shooters (Valorant, CS2, Overwatch):
- **Keep centered** - Most FPS games work best with centered crosshairs
- **Slight upward bias** - Consider 1-2px upward for headshot level
- **Avoid extreme offsets** - Small adjustments (¬±5px) are usually sufficient

#### Third-Person Games (Fortnite):
- **Lower positioning** - Character models affect optimal crosshair placement
- **Account for camera angle** - Third-person perspective requires different positioning
- **Building considerations** - Position for both shooting and building modes

#### Tactical Shooters (Rainbow Six Siege):
- **Precision focused** - Use minimal offsets for maximum accuracy
- **Doorway height** - Consider common angle heights in maps
- **Lean mechanics** - Account for lean peeking positions

### Advanced Techniques:
- **Weapon-specific positions** - Different positions for rifles vs pistols
- **Map-based adjustments** - Bright vs dark maps may need position tweaks
- **Resolution scaling** - Higher resolutions may need proportional adjustments
